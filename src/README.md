**EXERCISE USING SET**

- In an online course portal, each user have a unique code, represented by one integer. Each instructor of this portal can have how many courses he wants. So, the number of students of one instructor is not simply the sum of students of all the courses that it has, because students can be repeated in more than one course.
- Do a system who receipt the instructor, her courses and their students, so return how many unique students that instructor have.
